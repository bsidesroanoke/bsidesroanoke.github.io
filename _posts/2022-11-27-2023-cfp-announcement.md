Do you have an interesting security project that you'd like to share with the
community? Maybe it's that new insight you gathered during a recent exercise?
If so, then please consider speaking at BSides Roanoke 2023! 

We are looking for speakers across a variety of topics, such as pentesting
stories, risk frameworks, teaching a new skill/technique, or even fun projects
at home.
