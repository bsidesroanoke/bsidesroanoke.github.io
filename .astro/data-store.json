While eBPF offers tremendous potential for enhancing system performance, monitoring, and security, it also presents a significant risk when misused for malicious purposes. In this talk, we will explore the dual nature of eBPF and its implications for Linux security and malware development. We'll begin by discussing the legitimate uses of eBPF, such as creating efficient network filters, tracing and profiling applications, and implementing security policies at the kernel level. We'll examine real-world examples of how eBPF is being leveraged to enhance system visibility, detect threats, and enforce access controls.  However, we'll also delve into the darker side of eBPF and its potential for abuse. We'll demonstrate how attackers can exploit eBPF to develop sophisticated rootkits that operate at the kernel level, making them extremely difficult to detect and remove. We'll analyze the techniques used to inject malicious eBPF programs into the kernel, hijack system calls, and establish persistence on compromised systems.  Furthermore, we'll discuss the challenges and limitations of traditional security solutions when faced with eBPF-based malware. We'll highlight the need for advanced detection mechanisms and the importance of monitoring eBPF programs loaded into the kernel.  Throughout the talk, we'll provide practical examples, live demonstrations, and code snippets to illustrate the concepts discussed. We'll also explore potential mitigations and best practices for securing systems against eBPF-based threats.  Attendees will gain a deep understanding of eBPF's role in Linux security and malware development. They'll learn how to leverage eBPF for legitimate purposes while also being aware of its potential for abuse. We'll empower attendees with the knowledge and tools necessary to detect, analyze, and defend against eBPF-based malware.  Whether you're a security researcher, system administrator, or malware analyst, this talk will provide valuable insights into the complex landscape of eBPF and its implications for Linux security.

BSides Roanoke","### **What is a Security BSides Event?**\n\nSecurity BSides is a global series of community-organized cybersecurity conferences. The name comes from the \"B-side\" of a record—the place for the tracks that aren't the commercial hits but are often the most beloved by true fans.\n\nIn the same spirit, each BSides event is an open platform for security professionals, researchers, and hobbyists to share their latest ideas, in-depth research, and passion projects in a relaxed, community-driven atmosphere. It's a place for the conversations happening \"in the hallways\" of the big corporate conferences.\n\nTo learn more about the global movement, visit the official [Security BSides website](https://www.securitybsides.com/).\n\n---\n\n### **Our Local Chapter: BSides Roanoke**\n\nBSides Roanoke brings the global, community-driven spirit of BSides to the heart of Virginia's Blue Ridge. Our mission is to create an accessible, inclusive, and engaging event where our local tech community can gather to learn, collaborate, and grow. We are a vendor-neutral conference built by and for the Roanoke area's cybersecurity professionals, students, and enthusiasts.\n\n---\n\n### **Organized by Roanoke Infosec Exchange (RISE)**\n\nBSides Roanoke is proudly organized by the **Roanoke Infosec Exchange (RISE)**, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing information security knowledge and practices within our community.\n\nThe team behind RISE has a long history of serving the local tech scene, running free monthly meetups since 2015 and launching the first BSides Roanoke conference in 2019\\. Through the partnership of organizations like MAKE Roanoke, we have been able to build this event into a cornerstone of the local security calendar.\n\nOur vision is to establish Roanoke as a nationally recognized hub for information security excellence by cultivating talent, fostering collaboration, and securing the digital future for our community.\n\n### **Our Core Values**\n\nEverything we do is guided by a few simple but powerful principles:\n\n* **Collaboration:** We believe everyone’s unique experience and knowledge works best when shared. By sharing knowledge, we help everyone learn, grow, and be secure.  \n* **Stewardship:** We are committed to using our skills for good and holding ourselves accountable to our mission.  \n* **Inclusion:** We are dedicated to building a welcoming and supportive local community where everyone feels they belong, from seasoned professionals to curious enthusiasts.","src/content/about/about.md","d86349baf1e50de3",{"html":1404,"metadata":1405},"\u003Ch3 id=\"what-is-a-security-bsides-event\">\u003Cstrong>What is a Security BSides Event?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Security BSides is a global series of community-organized cybersecurity conferences.
