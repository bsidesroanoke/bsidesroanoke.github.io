While eBPF offers tremendous potential for enhancing system performance, monitoring, and security, it also presents a significant risk when misused for malicious purposes. In this talk, we will explore the dual nature of eBPF and its implications for Linux security and malware development. We'll begin by discussing the legitimate uses of eBPF, such as creating efficient network filters, tracing and profiling applications, and implementing security policies at the kernel level. We'll examine real-world examples of how eBPF is being leveraged to enhance system visibility, detect threats, and enforce access controls.  However, we'll also delve into the darker side of eBPF and its potential for abuse. We'll demonstrate how attackers can exploit eBPF to develop sophisticated rootkits that operate at the kernel level, making them extremely difficult to detect and remove. We'll analyze the techniques used to inject malicious eBPF programs into the kernel, hijack system calls, and establish persistence on compromised systems.  Furthermore, we'll discuss the challenges and limitations of traditional security solutions when faced with eBPF-based malware. We'll highlight the need for advanced detection mechanisms and the importance of monitoring eBPF programs loaded into the kernel.  Throughout the talk, we'll provide practical examples, live demonstrations, and code snippets to illustrate the concepts discussed. We'll also explore potential mitigations and best practices for securing systems against eBPF-based threats.  Attendees will gain a deep understanding of eBPF's role in Linux security and malware development. They'll learn how to leverage eBPF for legitimate purposes while also being aware of its potential for abuse. We'll empower attendees with the knowledge and tools necessary to detect, analyze, and defend against eBPF-based malware.  Whether you're a security researcher, system administrator, or malware analyst, this talk will provide valuable insights into the complex landscape of eBPF and its implications for Linux security.

That is not necessarily a bad thing; however, that lifestyle is not for everyone. Many people need to recharge by spending time in nature or with friends, but will that hurt their careers? It often leads to a case of imposter syndrome - feeling like they do not belong because their job is not their life or their only passion. Having outside interests does not make a person any less technically savvy. Diversity in interests and experiences is what makes many teams so successful. The question becomes how to use seemingly unrelated interests to help further career development. The key is to find opportunities to shine. In this flash talk, I will share how some of my interests, like football and crocheting, have led to new opportunities and how bringing my authentic self to work has helped me fight off imposter syndrome.\u003C/p>",{"headings":481,"localImagePaths":482,"remoteImagePaths":483,"frontmatter":484,"imagePaths":486},[],[],[],{"title":471,"speakers":485,"startTime":454,"endTime":472,"room":301,"eventSlug":200,"featured":180},[474],[],"instituting-a-boredom-free-cyber-awareness-culture",{"id":487,"data":489,"body":494,"filePath":495,"digest":496,"rendered":497},{"title":490,"startTime":491,"endTime":455,"room":301,"speakers":492,"eventSlug":200,"featured":180},"Instituting a Boredom-Free Cyber Awareness Culture","2024-10-26T20:00:00Z",[493],"jeff-hoge","It is easy to send emails to users, but very difficult to institute cyber awareness.
