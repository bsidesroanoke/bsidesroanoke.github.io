Our traditional approach to breach detection that is focused on triaging alerts generated by massive amounts of data from disparate sources is not working. Adversaries know this fact and regularly benefit from it.  The average breach goes unnoticed for 212 days. That’s an ample amount of time for anyone to surreptitiously run off with the crown jewels and inflict significant damage with ramifications that include consumer privacy violations, loss of trust, steep financial penalties, and irreversible reputational damage.  We need a new approach if we’re ever going to stop the madness. Hackers also deserve a better opponent.  This talk discusses a different way of thinking about breach detection that is intended to reduce the number of false positives, improve alert fidelity, reduce time-to-detection, and prevent the massive level of burnout affecting our industry.  We will cover the history of breach detection, the current state of affairs, the paradigm shift to new ways of thinking about the problem, practical examples of how to deploy effective breach detection technology, and the results of a red team campaign against a heavily layered network of deception inception.","src/content/talks/deception-inception-is-met-with-hilarious-reception.md","34a0de7ace50877f",{"html":182,"metadata":330},{"headings":331,"localImagePaths":332,"remoteImagePaths":333,"frontmatter":334,"imagePaths":336},[],[],[],{"title":323,"speakers":335,"startTime":265,"endTime":266,"room":306,"abstract":326,"eventSlug":174,"featured":180},[325],[],"ebpf-the-double-edged-sword-of-linux-security-and-malware",{"id":337,"data":339,"filePath":346,"digest":347,"rendered":348},{"title":340,"startTime":341,"endTime":342,"room":306,"speakers":343,"abstract":345,"eventSlug":174,"featured":180},"eBPF: The Double-Edged Sword of Linux Security and Malware","2024-10-26T18:05:00Z","2024-10-26T18:49:59Z",[344],"david-mitchell-digish0","Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) has emerged as a powerful tool in the Linux kernel, enabling developers to write custom programs that can be loaded into the kernel at runtime. While eBPF offers tremendous potential for enhancing system performance, monitoring, and security, it also presents a significant risk when misused for malicious purposes. In this talk, we will explore the dual nature of eBPF and its implications for Linux security and malware development. We'll begin by discussing the legitimate uses of eBPF, such as creating efficient network filters, tracing and profiling applications, and implementing security policies at the kernel level. We'll examine real-world examples of how eBPF is being leveraged to enhance system visibility, detect threats, and enforce access controls.  However, we'll also delve into the darker side of eBPF and its potential for abuse. We'll demonstrate how attackers can exploit eBPF to develop sophisticated rootkits that operate at the kernel level, making them extremely difficult to detect and remove. We'll analyze the techniques used to inject malicious eBPF programs into the kernel, hijack system calls, and establish persistence on compromised systems.  Furthermore, we'll discuss the challenges and limitations of traditional security solutions when faced with eBPF-based malware. We'll highlight the need for advanced detection mechanisms and the importance of monitoring eBPF programs loaded into the kernel.  Throughout the talk, we'll provide practical examples, live demonstrations, and code snippets to illustrate the concepts discussed. We'll also explore potential mitigations and best practices for securing systems against eBPF-based threats.  Attendees will gain a deep understanding of eBPF's role in Linux security and malware development. They'll learn how to leverage eBPF for legitimate purposes while also being aware of its potential for abuse. We'll empower attendees with the knowledge and tools necessary to detect, analyze, and defend against eBPF-based malware.  Whether you're a security researcher, system administrator, or malware analyst, this talk will provide valuable insights into the complex landscape of eBPF and its implications for Linux security.

Additionally, Ek47 supports packing payloads of .NET assemblies, unmanaged DLLs, and raw shellcode. Ek47 payloads are themselves .NET assemblies and can be uploaded to disk or executed reflectively via any execute-assembly method.

Impacket tools such as wmiexec, smbexec, and secretsdump are staples in the toolkit of any red teamer due to their versatility and flexibility in Windows environments. However, their detectability has increased as defensive measures have become more sophisticated. This session proposes modifications to these tools to avoid default IOCs and detections.  Participants will explore various customization strategies, including changing default settings, altering network signatures, and integrating stealthier execution methods. Practical exercises will guide attendees through the process of modifying the Impacket scripts, demonstrating how these changes can significantly enhance operational security in simulated environments.
