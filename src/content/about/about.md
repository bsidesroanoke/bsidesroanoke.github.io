### **What is a Security BSides Event?**

Security BSides is a global series of community-organized cybersecurity conferences. The name comes from the "B-side" of a record—the place for the tracks that aren't the commercial hits but are often the most beloved by true fans.

In the same spirit, each BSides event is an open platform for security professionals, researchers, and hobbyists to share their latest ideas, in-depth research, and passion projects in a relaxed, community-driven atmosphere. It's a place for the conversations happening "in the hallways" of the big corporate conferences.
