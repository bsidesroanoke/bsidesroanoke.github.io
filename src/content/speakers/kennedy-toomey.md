With a background in computer science, I transitioned to Application Security seamlessly after college. My goal is to make security easily accessible to everyone, through improving security culture and the developer experience. I believe that security should be a team that helps guide people forward instead of being a frustrating blocker. I am passionate about getting minorities, especially women, excited about security.
