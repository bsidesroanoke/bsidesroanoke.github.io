Brian has built a long career as an infrastructure expert with a passion for security. This has led him to many opportunities to work as an engineer and leader building infrastructure for general use, as well as working to build systems that directly support security use cases. In the late 2000s he built his first log server using syslog-ng and MySQL, and long-lasting love affair with managing machine data for security was kindled. Today Brian continues that work by leading teams in developing modern, flexible platforms for threat detection and response.
