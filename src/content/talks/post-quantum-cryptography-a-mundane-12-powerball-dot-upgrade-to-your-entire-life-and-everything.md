Quantum computing, driven by AI, will take over the world. You’ll lose your job, your privacy, your freedom, even your life. How??? MAGIC. LITERAL MAGIC. Your situation is hopeless. You can’t fight magic!  UNTIL NOW. Introducing: post-quantum cryptography! If you thought your typical gold-level cryptography was effective, get ready to blow right past platinum and quantum levels straight to POST-QUANTUM level. This stuff is literally the “Expelliarmus” to quantum computing’s “Avada Kedavra.” In this thrilling talk, we will discuss quantum mechanics (magic), quantum computing (also magic), and how to fight these evil tools of government conspirators with the maximum 1000XP top-quality get-it-while-supplies-last post-quantum cryptography!  …or maybe, in the spirit of Craig Martell, we will reveal how overhyped and mundane this highly-specialized computing system is, and then look into some of the interesting algorithms being developed to resist these efficient password-cracking machines.  …but which talk will you receive??? YOU’LL HAVE TO SHOW UP TO FIND OUT!
