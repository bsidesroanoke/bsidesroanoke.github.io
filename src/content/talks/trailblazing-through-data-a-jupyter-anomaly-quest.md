The talk will introduce ready-to-use Jupyter Notebooks for large-scale threat hunting in production environment. Rather than looking at terabytes of data in a traditional tabular format, we will explore the effectiveness of visualizations, emphasizing graphs, to identify and investigate outliers. The primary area of focus would be Anomaly Detection applied to substantial volume of data to generate Alerts for SOC based on Windows Sysmon Endpoint Logs and Zeek/Suricata Netflow Logs.
