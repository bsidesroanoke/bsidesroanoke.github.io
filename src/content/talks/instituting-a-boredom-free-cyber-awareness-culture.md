It is easy to send emails to users, but very difficult to institute cyber awareness. At the end of the day, we must ask ourselves: Do our users care? Are they likely to notify us when cyber threats occur, to ignore them, or to "take the bait" and become another victim? Your organization may be at any level of cyber maturity, but every company's security program needs to devote resources to building its culture through boredom-free security awareness training.

During this presentation, Jeff will share his experiences, frustrations, and insights, followed by an open discussion. He will cover:
• Why the typical canned template training modules don't work... on their own.
• How to implement incentives to help (and not hurt) your cyber program.
• Helping the workforce become more secure in their personal lives, leading to a more secure organization.
• Making security awareness training fun through gamification and a spirit of competition.
