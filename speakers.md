**Workshop**: Turning Data Into Intelligence / Intelligence from Data Dumps	

**Workshop Synopsis**: This workshop teaches the attendee the basics of network

This workshop will focus on both people, indicators of compromise, and a
technique known as master merging.

methodologies can be applied.  We will cover the intelligence cycle and how you
can modify it to suit your needs, indexing raw data, creating templates,
production, social network analysis, and master merging.
