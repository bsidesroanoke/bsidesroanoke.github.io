The [Roanoke Information Security Exchange](https://roanokeinfosec.com/) and
[Noke Codes](http://nokecodes.org/) in partnership with 
[Virginia Western Community College](https://www.virginiawestern.edu/) are happy
to announce the Security BSides event in the Roanoke region!

So what is BSides? BSides is a community-driven event for and by information
security community members. The goal is to expand the spectrum of conversation
beyond the traditional confines of space and time. It creates opportunities for
individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that
encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and
interaction from participants. It is where conversations about the
next-big-thing are happening.  Thousands of people have attended and written
about their experience at BSides events. Read more at:
