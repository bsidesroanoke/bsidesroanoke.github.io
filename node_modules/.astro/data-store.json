While eBPF offers tremendous potential for enhancing system performance, monitoring, and security, it also presents a significant risk when misused for malicious purposes. In this talk, we will explore the dual nature of eBPF and its implications for Linux security and malware development. We'll begin by discussing the legitimate uses of eBPF, such as creating efficient network filters, tracing and profiling applications, and implementing security policies at the kernel level. We'll examine real-world examples of how eBPF is being leveraged to enhance system visibility, detect threats, and enforce access controls.  However, we'll also delve into the darker side of eBPF and its potential for abuse. We'll demonstrate how attackers can exploit eBPF to develop sophisticated rootkits that operate at the kernel level, making them extremely difficult to detect and remove. We'll analyze the techniques used to inject malicious eBPF programs into the kernel, hijack system calls, and establish persistence on compromised systems.  Furthermore, we'll discuss the challenges and limitations of traditional security solutions when faced with eBPF-based malware. We'll highlight the need for advanced detection mechanisms and the importance of monitoring eBPF programs loaded into the kernel.  Throughout the talk, we'll provide practical examples, live demonstrations, and code snippets to illustrate the concepts discussed. We'll also explore potential mitigations and best practices for securing systems against eBPF-based threats.  Attendees will gain a deep understanding of eBPF's role in Linux security and malware development. They'll learn how to leverage eBPF for legitimate purposes while also being aware of its potential for abuse. We'll empower attendees with the knowledge and tools necessary to detect, analyze, and defend against eBPF-based malware.  Whether you're a security researcher, system administrator, or malware analyst, this talk will provide valuable insights into the complex landscape of eBPF and its implications for Linux security. Join us as we explore the double-edged sword of eBPF and arm ourselves with the knowledge to wield it responsibly.","src/content/talks/ebpf-the-double-edged-sword-of-linux-security-and-malware.md","94b1f86e68d6a7fe",{"html":189,"metadata":229},{"headings":230,"localImagePaths":231,"remoteImagePaths":232,"frontmatter":233,"imagePaths":235},[],[],[],{"title":220,"speakers":234,"startTime":221,"endTime":222,"room":203,"abstract":225,"eventSlug":184,"featured":185},[224],[],"beyond-the-flipper-a-guide-to-basic-wireless-communication-protocols",{"id":236,"data":238,"filePath":245,"digest":246,"rendered":247},{"title":239,"startTime":240,"endTime":241,"room":180,"speakers":242,"abstract":244,"eventSlug":184,"featured":185},"Beyond the Flipper - A guide to basic wireless communication protocols","2024-10-26T17:10:00Z","2024-10-26T17:54:59Z",[243],"brandon-lester","This talk will explore the basic concepts relating to wireless protocols used by consumer devices, how to decode, fuzz, and repeat commands, and a comparison between the Flipper Zero and other open-source hardware/software solutions.","src/content/talks/beyond-the-flipper-a-guide-to-basic-wireless-communication-protocols.md","25cb7c236ea1a9f5",{"html":189,"metadata":248},{"headings":249,"localImagePaths":250,"remoteImagePaths":251,"frontmatter":252,"imagePaths":254},[],[],[],{"title":239,"speakers":253,"startTime":240,"endTime":241,"room":180,"abstract":244,"eventSlug":184,"featured":185},[243],[],"ek47-payload-encryption-with-environmental-keys",{"id":255,"data":257,"filePath":265,"digest":266,"rendered":267},{"title":258,"startTime":259,"endTime":260,"room":203,"speakers":261,"abstract":264,"eventSlug":184,"featured":185},"Ek47 – Payload Encryption with Environmental Keys","2024-10-26T19:55:00Z","2024-10-26T20:39:59Z",[262,263],"kevin-clark","skyler-knecht","Ek47 is a payload encryptor that leverages user-selected environmental keys associated with a target execution context.

Ek47 supports many different environmental keys such as current user, domain, computer name, installed programs, and more. Additionally, Ek47 supports packing payloads of .NET assemblies, unmanaged DLLs, and raw shellcode. Ek47 payloads are themselves .NET assemblies and can be uploaded to disk or executed reflectively via any execute-assembly method. By default, a standard AMSI/ETW bypass is executed before the main payload is executed, but Ek47 makes it easy to add custom bypasses for more advanced evasion functionality.

This workshop is designed for penetration testers, aspiring red teamers, and individuals seeking to enhance their offensive capabilities. It focuses on customizing the Impacket toolset to improve OpSec during engagements.  Impacket tools such as wmiexec, smbexec, and secretsdump are staples in the toolkit of any red teamer due to their versatility and flexibility in Windows environments. However, their detectability has increased as defensive measures have become more sophisticated. This session proposes modifications to these tools to avoid default IOCs and detections.  Participants will explore various customization strategies, including changing default settings, altering network signatures, and integrating stealthier execution methods. Practical exercises will guide attendees through the process of modifying the Impacket scripts, demonstrating how these changes can significantly enhance operational security in simulated environments.  Attendees will gain hands-on experience modifying the Impacket tool set to remove common IOCs. The workshop aims to foster a deeper understanding of both the tools and the underlying network protocols, enabling participants to tailor their approaches to specific operational contexts and defensive landscapes.","src/content/talks/modifying-impacket-for-better-opsec.md","e7d166381e1ff81b",{"html":189,"metadata":322},{"headings":323,"localImagePaths":324,"remoteImagePaths":325,"frontmatter":326,"imagePaths":328},[],[],[],{"title":314,"speakers":327,"startTime":201,"endTime":315,"room":203,"abstract":318,"eventSlug":184,"featured":185},[317],[],"post-quantum-cryptography-a-mundane-12-powerball-dot-upgrade-to-your-entire-life-and-everything",{"id":329,"data":331,"filePath":337,"digest":338,"rendered":339},{"title":332,"startTime":333,"endTime":315,"room":203,"speakers":334,"abstract":336,"eventSlug":184,"featured":185},"Post Quantum Cryptography: A Mundane-12 Powerball Dot Upgrade to Your Entire Life and Everything!","2024-10-26T20:50:00Z",[335],"schr0ding3r","Quantum computing, driven by AI, will take over the world.

That’s an ample amount of time for anyone to surreptitiously run off with the crown jewels and inflict significant damage with ramifications that include consumer privacy violations, loss of trust, steep financial penalties, and irreversible reputational damage.
