## Purpose

> “Respect for right conduct is felt by every body.” – Jane Austen

BSidesROA was built to bring together people who have curiosity and passion for
information security. We strive to be a gathering where anyone of any gender,
race, nationality, religion, or sexual orientation can meet, learn, and grow.

To achieve this goal, BSidesROA borrowed this code of conduct from
[BSidesNoVA](https://www.bsidesnova.org/code-of-conduct-2/) as it was well
written. The Code of Conduct is meant to create an environment that allows for
respectful discourse, constructive debate, open sharing, and positive
interactions while facilitating a safe and secure setting for those activities.

All attendees, speakers, staff, media, vendors, sponsors, volunteers, or other participants at BSidesROA are asked to follow the below Code of Conduct. Interpretation of the Code of Conduct will be at the sole discretion of the BSidesROA staff and board.

## Acceptable Conduct

> “Seek first to understand, then to be understood.” – Stephen Covey

Acceptable behavior during BSidesROA includes, but is not limited to:

Showing respect and consideration for anyone you interact with.  Participating
in activities that aren’t or can’t be construed as demeaning, insulting,
offensive, or harassing.  Assuming positive intent and seeking clarification
during discussions where misinterpretation is possible.  Engaging in positive
and open discussion.  Being aware of your surroundings and fellow participants:
If you see someone violating the Code of Conduct, in an unsafe or threatening
situation, violating venue rules, or breaking laws contact a staff member or
volunteer immediately. If this is an emergency situation do not hesitate to
contact venue security or law enforcement.  

## Unacceptable Conduct

> “I’m not shy about heated debate or passionate discourse, but when people get crazy or rude, that’s a buzz kill. There’s got to be a better code of conduct, some basic etiquette.” – Mos Def

Unacceptable behavior at BSidesROA includes, but is not limited to:

* Any intimidation, harassment, abusive, lewd, discriminatory, derogatory, and/or offensive actions or materials that make anyone at BSidesROA feel unwelcome or unsafe.
* Assault of any kind including, but not limited to, verbal attacks and inappropriate physical contact.
* Assumption of consent for any actions where consent must be explicit.
