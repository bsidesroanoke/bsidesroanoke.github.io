## CTF - [What is Capture The Flag?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity))
Our CTF is beginner friendly and meant to be fun. All you need to participate is your laptop (don't forget your charger!) and the sign up link which will be provided in person. [Discord](https://discord.gg/bqJyG558GP).

T.Weeks will be giving a demo/overview of the CTF at the start time (10am) in room M302.  You're free to camp out in the CTF room, but there won't be any more formal events in there until the 1pm and 4pm for the Software Defined Radio labs (also CTF related).  So we encourage you to get out and play from anywhere in the grounds so you won't miss the other great speakers and workshops! Play throughout the day from wherever you are! You can even play the CTF from the bathrooms (if you have good connectivity ;).
### The CTF is located in room M302 on the 3rd floor.
