IT/security experts and thought leaders — all deep diving into various
cybersecurity topics that are currently shaping our ever-changing cybersecurity
landscape. From Randy Marchany's keynote on the enduring nature of IT-evolution
to Logan Diomedi's talk on how Microsoft's SCCM can be turned and used against
you, to talks on the Flipper-zero/RF signal hacking, and social engineering
deception tactics.  Learn how blackhat attackers are currently attempting to
gain access to your networks and systems, and how to fortify your defenses
against them. Other talks include Jupyter anomaly detection, the dangers of
Linux/eBPF, next-level password cracking, infrastructure encryption strategies,
and much more. We even have a live Capture the Flag with RF badge challenges and
Zeek network vulnerability analysis with awards and prizes! We even have all day
coffee and lunch provided.  Don't miss out on this opportunity to expand your
knowledge and network with other IT-Security peers and vendors!
